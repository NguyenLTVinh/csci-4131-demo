This is a guide on how to set up a remote connection to a CSE lab machine with VSCode. Remote development allows you to work on code that resides on a remote machine as if it were on your local machine. You won't need this for the first few assignments, but you will need to when we eventually work with SQL databases. It is recommended that you do remote development on a CSE lab machine from the start to familiarize yourself with the process.
